# AI Help Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension is designed to provide AI assistance for solving coding problems directly within the browser. It uses the Google Gemini AI model to offer guidance, solutions, and code examples. The extension integrates with a website hosting coding problems, allowing users to easily get help via a chatbot interface.

## Features

- **AI Help Button**: Adds an "AI Help" button to coding problem pages. This button opens a chatbot that assists with solving problems, providing hints, and answering related queries.
- **Custom API Key**: Users enter their API key for the AI model via the extension's popup interface. Once entered, the chatbot fetches AI responses using this key.
- **User-friendly UI**: Sleek, modern, and responsive popup and chatbot interfaces with pleasant user interactions.
- **Message History**: Chat history is saved and used to provide contextual information to the AI model.
- **Clear Chat History**: A dedicated button to clear the chat history directly from the chatbot interface, with smooth UI feedback to confirm the action.
- **Input/Output Formatting**: Collects information from the page, including problem descriptions, hints, input/output formats, and constraints, and sends it to the AI for processing.
- **User's Code as Context**: The user's current code, based on the selected language, is included in the prompt sent to the AI to provide relevant code-specific context and suggestions.
- **Theme Change**: The chatbot's theme can now be dynamically changed based on the selected page theme. This feature allows the extension to match the look and feel of the host website by adjusting the UI colors (container background, header, buttons, etc.) based on the active theme.
